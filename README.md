# Important notice
I am in a hurry and submit this project late. I know this documentation is far away from complete and likewise the responsiveness of the website. I am in the aha! moment now in all of these but time is pressing hard against me. Things I will work further and that is lacking in this project is the clean documentation in the markdown file and responsivity of the website.
